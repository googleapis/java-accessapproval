/**
 * A client to Access Approval API.
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>========================= AccessApprovalAdminClient =========================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: This API allows a customer to manage accesses to cloud resources by
 * Google personnel. It defines the following resource model:
 *
 * <p>- The API has a collection of
 * [ApprovalRequest][google.cloud.accessapproval.v1.ApprovalRequest] resources, named
 * `approvalRequests/{approval_request_id}` - The API has top-level settings per
 * Project/Folder/Organization, named `accessApprovalSettings`
 *
 * <p>The service also periodically emails a list of recipients, defined at the
 * Project/Folder/Organization level in the accessApprovalSettings, when there is a pending
 * ApprovalRequest for them to act on. The ApprovalRequests can also optionally be published to a
 * Cloud Pub/Sub topic owned by the customer (for Beta, the Pub/Sub setup is managed manually).
 *
 * <p>ApprovalRequests can be approved or dismissed. Google personel can only access the indicated
 * resource or resources if the request is approved (subject to some exclusions:
 * https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/overview#exclusions).
 *
 * <p>Note: Using Access Approval functionality will mean that Google may not be able to meet the
 * SLAs for your chosen products, as any support response times may be dramatically increased. As
 * such the SLAs do not apply to any service disruption to the extent impacted by Customer's use of
 * Access Approval. Do not enable Access Approval for projects where you may require high service
 * availability and rapid response by Google Cloud Support.
 *
 * <p>After a request is approved or dismissed, no further action may be taken on it. Requests with
 * the requested_expiration in the past or with no activity for 14 days are considered dismissed.
 * When an approval expires, the request is considered dismissed.
 *
 * <p>If a request is not approved or dismissed, we call it pending. LINT.IfChange
 *
 * <p>Sample for AccessApprovalAdminClient:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (AccessApprovalAdminClient accessApprovalAdminClient = AccessApprovalAdminClient.create()) {
 *   String name = "";
 *   ApprovalRequest response = accessApprovalAdminClient.getApprovalRequest(name);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
